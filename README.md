Introduction to SuperCollider
=============================

In this intro to algorithmic music in SuperCollider, we don't have enough time
to go too deeply into the pattern library (which is incredibly deep), but we'll
go far enough to give you a taste of the possibilities, and we can spend some
time at the end of the workshop talking about more advanced techniques.

There is no prior knowledge of SuperCollider necessary for this workshop,
but neither are we going to cover any fundamentals of synthesis in SC. If
you are new to SC, but have other synthesis environments that you use, you
might consider looking into the MIDI out or OSC capabilities of SC.

A background in programming or music (or both) will be very helpful
in understanding the material, but is not required.
